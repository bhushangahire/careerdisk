Phase -I

 
Indian companies generally goes to univerties and colleges for recuritment purpose.
It happens sometimes that executive do not have time to go for recruitment.
If any companies looking for top 10 student from each college from all over india they calling 
fresh graguate is very difficult
So The objective to create a  eletronic campus where companies can invite to students from various colleges
for recuritment in a single click. Student will also able to apply for recuritment to all companies
it is only for fresher not for professional having exprience


So there are various entities in system

1. universities
2. college  
3. student
4. companies
5. job or campus event
6. categories
7. location (country state)
I have designed few model but they are not accurate it

Since university have many colleges and college run the various courses(for graguate student)
Comanies have association with various sector like finance , manufacturing , service etc

there are two section of this web application 

1. front end (visible to all)
